This is a **test project** on procedul generation algorithms.

## The Game

It's a test project so there is not an actual objective.

You can try and see the different algorithms / scripts for procedural generation.

## Requirements

If you want to open, edit or see the Unity project:
* Unity 2020.3.6f1 (or greater)

# Procedural Generation Tests

1. **Basic procedural generation** - The script starts from a starting point and then it chooses randomly one of the 4 possible directions (up - down - left - right) till to reach the max numbers of tiles set.
It also fills holes made of only 1 block and it adds lava/water all around the generated map.

2. **Perlin noise map generation** - The map is generated based on Perlin noise

It's interesting the result that you obtain by using tiles of different heights
